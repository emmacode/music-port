This is a lerna monorepo containing 2 packages; a frontend app and a backend app. We intend to expand it sometime in the future with other packages.

**- Everything here is built from scratch while leveraging basic libraries like Express, ReactJs etc**

**- We don't use Sequelize, NextJs or any mature framework. Goal is to learn while building from scratch and also make this platform usable**

See the documentation of each package to understand its underlining architecture, concepts and design ideologies.
